                In celebration of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy's 20th anniversary,
                famous artist Fujiko Nakaya created an exhibition of multiple "fog sculptures",
                inviting visitors to immerse
                themselves in the art and appreciate the importance of the parks. <br><br>

                Nakaya communicates to us through her fog sculptures. Wouldn't it be fun if we could
                send her our thoughts and messages? <br><br>

                This website contains postcards dedicated to Fujiko Nakaya,
                drawn and written by people who have been to the exhibition.
