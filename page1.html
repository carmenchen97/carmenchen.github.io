        Michael Lin is a mechanical engineer and a freelance photographer.<br><br>
        He saw the exhibition on social media and decided to go take some photos of it.<br><br>
        The first visit didn't go well for him as it started raining while he was waiting,
        and the fog dissipated within minutes because of the rain.
